                           This has been produced during validation of TTBOX from
                           the 15.05.1992 version of program REMODL, which is available
                           at ORFEUS.

ttbox_testdata_mkfindp: test data used for profiling TTBOX. This is input data for MKFINDP.
                        The data set has no specific meaning, it's just do produce a nontrivial call.
								the file also contains refrence output for MKFINDP and MKTTCURVES from the
								unchanged software. This can be used to validate changes in the software.
								(The profiler test data has no specific use for you, the user, but I
								wanted to archive it somewhere. This was the natural place to do so.)

ttbox_profiler_data.txt: output from the MatLab profiler, produced during TTBOX optimization in 2005
                   This file contains cpu times spent in several of the TTBOX routines which
						 were identified to be the most severe bottlenecks.
						 the test carried out was a call to MKFINDP with a certain test data set (given in
						 the file ttbox_testdata_mkfindp)
						 first column: function name
						 second column: number of child functions called by this function
						 third column: number of calls to the function
						 fourth comlumn: total time spent in that function (including child function calls)
						 fifth column: self time of that function
						 sixth column: rank number on the list of most evil time wasters
