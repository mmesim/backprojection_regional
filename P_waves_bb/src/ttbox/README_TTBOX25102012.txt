 
The installation of TTBOX is relatively simple. All you have to do is to create some directories and tell MatLab, where TTBOX is.

    if it does not already exist, create a directory matlab within your home directory.
    Copy the TTBOX directory into the matlab directory
    if it does not already exist, create a file startup.m within the matlab directory
    Insert the following lines into startup.m:

    basepath='This should be the path to your home directory!';
    addpath([basepath filesep 'matlab' filesep 'ttbox'],1);
    addpath([basepath filesep 'matlab' filesep 'ttbox' filesep 'support'],1);
          

    execute startup within the MatLab command window.
    MatLab is now ready to execute TTBOX routines.
    The startup-script will be executed automatically upon start of MatLab.
    In order to read the online documentation, you have to browse to the doc directory and open the ttbox/doc/ttbox.html file with your web browser (it is recommended to set a bookmark).

It is not important where the TTBOX routines and the support directory reside. What is important, is that an addpath-call during startup tells MatLab where it actually is. Please refer to the MatLab documentation to find out about startup behavior of MatLab and its search path list.
