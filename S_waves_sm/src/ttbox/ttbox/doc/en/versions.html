  <h4>Release Notes, or About Versions of TTBOX</h4>
  
  <p>
  This section is about software changes, version identification and numbering.
  </p>
  <p>
  Software usually comes with a version number. The MatLab versions I have used
  most of the time when developing TTBOX are named "6.1.0.450 (R12.1)" and "7.2.0.294 (R2006a)". There are
  probably only few people who really understand what this means. Does a version
  "6.1.0.449 (R12.1)" exist? I don't know.
  </p>
  <p>
  TTBOX does not use version numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am continuously working on TTBOX routines, fixing bugs, introducing new features
  or even new routines. From time to time, I freeze a version when I have the impression
  that the current status is a good one, or when I'm planning major changes which may
  result in a complete disaster. Then I copy everything into a separate folder and
  enter a "freeze date" into the title page of the online documentation. Therefore a certain
  "version" of TTBOX is referred to as a "Freeze" with a certain date. Should you have a
  Documentation which is entitled "version not frozen" in the documentation, then it is some
  undefined conglomerate which is probably stolen from me.

  The following freezes exist:
