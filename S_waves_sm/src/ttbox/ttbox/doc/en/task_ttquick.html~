  <h4>Travel Time Curves for Specific Distance Samples</h4>
  
  <p>
  When MKTTCURVES computes travel times, it scans the take off angle of each phase
  with a constant angular increment. This translates into an uneven sampling of
  epicentral distance. But in many cases one would like to have travel times for
  a set of specific predefined epicentral distances.
  </p>
  <p>
  A loop which calls MKTTIME many times could be used to produce travel time curves
  in such cases, but it would waste a lot of CPU time to do so, since each call of
  MKTTIME invokes MKSHOOTRAY to determine the necessary ray parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is far better to use MKTTQUICK with a list of ray parameters that correspoond to
  the desired epicentral distances:
  </p>
  <ol>
     <li>Call <span class="tt">[p,a,d]=mkshootray(phase,delta,h,model);</span> with input parameters
         <dl>
            <dt>phase</dt>
            <dd>The seismic phase for which you would like to have travel times</dd>
            <dt>delta</dt>
            <dd>A list of epicentral distances, in degrees</dd>
            <dt>h</dt>
            <dd>Source depth in kilometers. This has to be a single value!
            </dd>
            <dt>model</dt>
            <dd>a MODEL structure containing the velocity model</dd>
         </dl>
     </li>
     <li>Call <span class="tt">ttcurves=mkttquick(model,h,p,a,phase);</span> with input
         parameters
         <dl>
            <dt>model</dt>
            <dd>a MODEL structure containing the velocity model</dd>
            <dt>h</dt>
            <dd>Source depth in kilometers. This has to be a single value!</dd>
            <dt>p</dt>
            <dd>Output parameter <span class="tt">p</span> from MKFINDP. This is a list of ray parameters
                which corresponds to the list of epicentral distances used in
                the call of MKFINDP</dd>
            <dt>a</dt>
            <dd>Output parameter <span class="tt">a</span> from MKFINDP. This is a list of take off
                angles, corresponding to the ray parameters at source depths.
                These angles are necesary to distinguish upgoing from downgoing
                rays, when a non-surface source is used.</dd>
            <dt>phase</dt>
            <dd>The seismic phase for which you would like to have travel times.
                This has to be the same as in the call of MKFINDP.</dd>
         </dl>
     <span class="tt">ttcurves</span> is now a TTCURVES structure as returned by MKTTCUVRES,
     but sampled at the distances you initially defined when calling MKFINDP.</li>
	  <li>You can now
	  		<ol>
		  <li>Call <span class="tt">mkplotttcurves(ttcurves,linespec);</span> to plot the travel time curves. Here, <span class="tt">linespec</span> is a
	  MatLab linspec string as accepted by the plot command.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>Call <span class="tt">mkrayfan(phase,a,h,model);</span> to plot the corresponding ray paths.</li>
	  		</ol>
	  </li>
  </ol>
