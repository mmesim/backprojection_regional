  <h5>Introduction</h5>
  <p>
  The Travel Time Toolbox (TTBOX) is a 
  <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/" target="extern">MatLab</a><span class="sup">&#174;</span>
  Toolbox for computation of seismic travel times and ray paths in spherical 1D velocity models 
  of terrestrial planets. It is written completely in the MatLab programming Language and
  does not make use of any precompiled FORTRAN or C or JAVA (or, in general, MEX) files.
  </p>
  <p>
  The goal behind the development of TTBOX was to have a travel time calculation software
  which </p>
  <ul>
  <li>allows a quick change of velocity models,</li>
  <li>allows a self-contained description of such models,</li>
  <li>does not make implicit assumptions about the planet under considerations
      (except sphericity, of course)</li>
  <li>integrates smoothly with other MatLab programs,</li>
  <li>is independent of sudden changes of formats or calling sequences 
  in third-party software.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>
  An important point was the necessity to compute travel times not only for the earth but also
  for Moon and Mars - this requires, for example, to define the planetary radius within the
  model files.
  </p>
  <p>
  TTBOX uses relatively simple algorithms - it just traces rays straight forward through
  a flat layered velocity model. This limits the performance, compared to the sophisticated methods
  developed by Buland & Chapman (1983), but it keeps the software relatively transparent and simple.
  </p>
  <p>
  The MatLab programming language and its flexibility with data types and calling sequences
  allows for convenient, compact and easy-to-maintain routines.

  <h5>This Documentation</h5>

  <p>
  This Documentation is mainly a technical reference to data structures and file formats,
  but also gives information on theoretical backround and, last but not least, a tutorial
  to the most important tasks. The help lines for the individual routines, which you can
  get from the MatLab Console by entering 
  </p>
  <pre>
  >>help filename
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
   are also accessible from this Documentation.
  </p>
  <p>It is assumed that you
  are familiar with MatLab.
  </p>
  <p>The documentation is structured
  as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>First of all, the <a href="toc/toc_intro_comput.html" target="toc">theoretical fundamentals</a> are given: how the Flat Earth Transformation
  is used to compute the traveltimes and ray paths.</li>
  <li>This is accompanied by a section on <a href="toc/toc_intro_valid.html" target="toc">software validation</a>, in which the quality of TTBOX
  travel time results ist compared with IASP91 reference times.</li>
  <li>A <a href="toc/toc_tutor.html" target="toc">Tutorial</a>, which describes how to get started and the most common tasks.</li>
  <li>A description of the <a href="toc/toc_datastruct.html" target="toc">data structures</a> used. Several structures are aused to
  represent velocity models and travel time results.</li>
  <li>The <a href="toc/toc_prg.html" target="toc">programs reference section</a> is divided into a subsection on
  <a href="toc/toc_prg_user.html" target="toc">User routines</a>, i.e. routines
  which the user will call directly in order to solve his (or her) problems, and
  <a href="toc/toc_prg_engin.html" target="toc">Engine Routines</a>,
  which are usually called by the User Routines, but not by the User.
  An <a href="toc/toc_prg_index.html" target="toc">alphabetic program index</a> allows to find a specific routine quickly.</li>
  <li><a href="toc/toc_prg.html" target="toc">Error Messages</a> cast by TTBOX routines are also explained in the programs reference section.</li>
  <li>The last section describes the <a href="toc/toc_files.html" target="toc">file formats</a> used to store velocity models.</li>
  </ul>

  As you may have noticed aready, this documentation usually avoids linking between pages, because hyperlinking usually
  brings readers out of track. Instead, links open the appropriate part of the
  Table of Contents in order to show where more information may be found.
